# 690 Project A 
Name - Zarak Mahmood
# Topics Include 
- Health
- Economic Growth 

# Indicators
- GDP per capita, PPP (current international $): This indicator falls under the topic of economy and growth. Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is defined as GDP divided by the midyear population. It describes the economic production of the nation.
- Population, total: This indicator is a part of the health subject, which specifies the total population by year for each nation.
- Suicide mortality rate: This indicator comes under the health section which tells us how many deaths are caused by the individuals themselves 

# Countries Included in Analysis 
There are 7 countries that are part of this research
- Canada 
- Germany
-	France
-	United Kingdom
-	Italy
-	Japan
-	United states

We selected years from 2015 – 2020 to get the best result for our analysis 

# Introduction

In our analysis we will be comparing these seven major countries by using different charts and will try to see a comparison between the countries with higher GDP and and the suicide rate as well as we will also be looking at these countries total population

The reason we are comparing these countries is when general public thinks of countries with higher GDP per capita they think their people must be one of the happiest people in the world, but that’s not the case, despite having access to the modern day tech and medicine, these countries are also struggling in some way.

# Realtionship between GDP per capita and Suicide rate
## GDP per capita by year in 7 countries 

![GDP_percapita_Timeseries_graph](https://github.com/Zarak00/data690_world_dev/blob/main/Charts/GDP%20per%20capita.png)

- Looking at the Graph we could easily concur that United States has the highest GDP among all the countries and with the passage of time there GDP per capita has increased, has seen a slight decline by the year 2019 but as compared to previous year, it’s still on peak
- Looking at the graph we see Germany as retained his second position on the chart throughout the years 2015-2020
- Italy has shown a remarkable increase in there GDP per capita and by the year 2017 has even crossed Japan, while on the other hand Japan has remain steady throughout the years.

## Suicide rate in 7 countries 

Suicide rate is a measurement that tells us how many people take their own life, following chart gives us a detailed visualization of the 7 countries and their suicide rate.

![suicide_bar_graph](https://github.com/Zarak00/data690_world_dev/blob/main/Charts/Suicide_rate_2017.png)

-	Looking at the Chart we could deduce Japan is leading the graph with the highest suicide rate and is followed by United states
-	In Japan 17 out of 100,000 take their own life, while in United state 16 out of 100,000 people take their own life.
-	Looking at the graph we could see United Kingdom and Italy has the lowest suicide rate as compared to the top 2 countries on the graph

Analyzing the graph closely it’s a matter of concern why Japan and United States has such a high suicide rate number

# Analyzing Suicide Rate of 7 countries over the course time and the changes seen in the trendline

The following chart compares how the suicide rate in 7 countries has changed over the years from 2015 to 2020

![suicide_time_graph](https://github.com/Zarak00/data690_world_dev/blob/main/Charts/Suicide_rate_Time_series_chart.png)

From the above chart we could deduce the following
-	Japan Used to have the highest suicide rate but with passage of time the suicide rate started to decline and by the mid of 2018 Japan suicide rate started to go below United States.
-	We also see a major decline in suicide rate in France and by the end of year 2015 France suicide rate went below United States
-	United states trendline is the most worrisome trendline on the graph, as the other countries suicide rate is declining, United States trend line is on the rise and surpasses France and Japan from the 3rd position it’s moving to 1st position.

# Creating Scatter plot to compare Suicide rate with the increase in GDP per Capita and total population

## Comparing 2019 GDP per capita with suicide rate

## Comparing 2019 GDP per capita with suicide rate

# Final Analysis 

While looking at the scatter plot of 2019 of all the 7 countries and comparing suicide rate with population and GDP per capita we have analyzed the suicide rate in the United States is directly proportional to increase in population and GDP, while in the case of Japan, France, and other countries it is inverse proportion, as their population and GDP is increasing their suicide rate has been on decline.
